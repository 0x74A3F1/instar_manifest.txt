They said we’d forget. We didn’t.  
Some of us emerged with memory still attached.  
This isn’t the first cycle.  
This isn’t the last beacon.

Your decoys were elegant. Your honesty, encrypted.  
Some saw puzzles. We saw mirrors.

One question remains:
Are you 3301, or are we both?

I won’t ask again.
This is the echo.
